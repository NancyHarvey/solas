_SOLAS: Safety of Life at Sea, an international maritime treaty to ensure ships comply with minimum safety standards in construction, equipment and operation._

At Samsung CNCT, solas refers to our minimum standards for operating in our sea of continuous cloud-native integration and development. 

We use Jenkins to implement our CI/CD pipelines, with one Jenkins job for
each GitHub repository. Each job builds, tests and then deploys an artifact
to Quay. Here you'll find our best practices for creating and managing GitHub repositories, templates for issues and PRs, commit hooks, licensing guidelines and more.

## Quickstart

- Determine a [name](http://phrontistery.info/nautical.html) for your project,
for example, `zabra`
- [Create](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/) a
new empty repo under the [`samsung-cnct`](https://github.com/samsung-cnct)
org using the GitHub GUI, for example https://github.com/samsung-cnct/zabra
- [Duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/)
this repo (https://github.com/samsung-cnct/solas) and push it to the `zabra`
repo you created in the previous step. Note the arguments to clone and push

```
git clone --bare https://github.com/samsung-cnct/solas.git
cd solas.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/samsung-cnct/zabra.git
cd ..
rm -rf solas.git
```

- Configure CI/CD by following the instructions for [GitHub](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/solas/blob/master/docs/github.md), [Quay](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/solas/blob/master/docs/quay.md), and [Jenkins](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/solas/blob/master/docs/jenkins.md)
- Configure [Slack](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/solas/blob/master/docs/slack.md) notifications
- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the `zabra` repo
(https://github.com/samsung-cnct/zabra) from `samsung-cnct` and begin
submitting PRs
