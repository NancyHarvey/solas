# Overview

This document details the steps to implement our CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins. Each GitHub repo contains one Jenkins job that builds, tests and then deploys an artifact to Quay, such as a container or a chart.

The following steps assume you have already duplicated a repo according to the
[README](../README.md) instructions and in conformance with [GitHub](./github.md)
and [Quay](./quay.md) guidelines.

## Edit the [Jenkinsfile](../Jenkinsfile)

* Edit the `container_name` or `image_name` and `robot_secret` at the top of
the [Jenkinsfile](../Jenkinsfile).

  * For container repositories:

```
def image_name            = "zabra-container";
def robot_secret          = "quay-robot-zabra-container-rw"
```

  The resulting container image will be deployed to the `quay.io` container
  repository at https://quay.io/application/samsung_cnct/zabra-container?namespace=samsung_cnct .

  Push these changes to the GitHub repository before proceeding.

  * For chart repositories:

```
def chart_name            = "zabra";
def robot_secret          = "quay-robot-zabra-rw"
```

  The resulting Helm chart will be deployed to the `quay.io` app
  repository at https://quay.io/application/samsung_cnct/zabra?namespace=samsung_cnct.

The secrets defined here were created during the [Quay](./quay.md) configuration.

## Chart Repositories Only: Edit the [Chart.yaml.in](../Chart.yaml.in)

* Edit the `name`, `description`, `home` and `sources`. Do not edit the `version`:

```
name: zabra
version: ${CHART_VER}-${CHART_REL}
description: Sample chart template for registry
keywords:
- kraken
home: https://github.com/samsung-cnct/chart-zabra
sources:
- https://github.com/samsung-cnct/chart-zabra
```

Also add any relevant keywords and look at other
related charts for inspiration. For example, if you're creating a logging chart, you might
look at the [Fluent Bit CHart](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/chart-fluent-bit).

Push these changes to the GitHub repository before proceeding.

## Configure Jenkins

### Log in and create the project

* Log in to your Jenkins server
* Create a new project by selecting `New Item` on the Jenkins homepage
  * Enter the repo name in the field at the top (for example, `container-zabra` or `chart-zabra`)
  * Select Multibranch Pipeline

### Configure GitHub

* Under `Branch Sources`, add GitHub as a source:

Configure Branch Sources as shown below.

Notes:
* Once you choose a credential, you may need to go back and select it.
* Under the GitHub Branch Source, add the additional behaviors "Advanced
checkout behaviors" and "Advanced clone behaviors," but don't change their
settings.
